# RunWithFriends
- Realtime online multiplayer running app -

Realtime online running app, where two players can connect privately online and then compete in a running race, whilst receiving realtime updates of their speed, and distance run.

This project was created for my A-level Computer Science coursework. It was developed during the first UK COVID-19 lockdown in order to re-motivate my brother to go out running, since he had lost his motivation with no friends to run with.

Uses a Google Firestore Realtime database to provide realtime updates of statistics throughout the race and uses Apple's Core Location GPS Framework.

Here are some screenshots of how the app works:

I also wrote a 26,000 word and 150 page report, documenting the work as part of the A-level coursework. The document explains the design process, exhibits proposed tests and clearly demonstrates my development process. Please feel free to look through the document.
